# Project setup
`npm install`

# Run locally
`npm run serve`

# Tags
* `project` = all projects must be tagged with this to correctly appear in the project list
* Must also have a tag that matches a project type in settings.yaml > projectTypes.
  * This same value must also be used for the `type` property

# TODO
- remove the need to set both a tag and type property, and instead just the tag
- add proper image unfurl for links
- convert flash games?
