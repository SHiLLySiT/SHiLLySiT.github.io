Nanonaut was originally created for the #23 Ludum Dare 'Tiny Planet' as a jam entry. I worked with three other people to create this game - [Chris Sinnott](http://www.sinnottsoundworks.com/) , [Thomas Jackson](http://www.shykoo.50webs.com/Welcome.html), and Travis Lucia. It was quite an ambitious project for such a small time period, yet we still ended up with a great game. Nanonaut is a game of exploration and adventure within a randomly generated world of tiny planets. By using the stargate in your ship, you can travel to planets to collect vital resources and research data. Beware! Not every planet will be full of flowers and pleasent creatures.
