This game is bursting with learning! Your little ones will pop their way into a whimsical world to learn letter sounds, phonics, and new words! Compatible with the Square Panda Playset, children love playtime as they use Square Panda smart letters to hear letter sounds and spell out new words. The more letters the child puts in the Playset, the more bubbles they get to pop! As your child pops bubbles they hear phonemic sounds and discover what real words are hiding behind the world of bubbles!
