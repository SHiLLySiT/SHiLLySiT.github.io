Expelliarmus is a short experimental game I created in a few hours. Type out the words that appear at the top of the screen faster than the AI opponent in order to cast a spell. Spells do damage based on the length of the spell. The first wizard to reach zero health loses! Special thanks to [Chris Sinnott](http://www.sinnottsoundworks.com/) for the theme song!
