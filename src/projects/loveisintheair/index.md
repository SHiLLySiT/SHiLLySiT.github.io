Love in the Air was created in 48 hours for Valentine's Day. It lacks much polish, but overall turned out quite well for my first Flash game! Each wave, there are a set number of hearts that travel towards the player. They must all be shot down with your limited number of missiles. This game was heavily inspired by the gaming classic, Missile Command.
