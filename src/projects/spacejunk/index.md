There are a total of 24 waves that the player must complete in order to finish the game. Normal waves consist of blasting incoming garbage and asteroids in order to obtain spacedust. Spacedust is then used to purchase upgrades for the planet between each wave. Every three waves a boss planet appears; each unique and requires a different strategy to defeat. Special thanks to [Chris Sinnott](http://www.sinnottsoundworks.com/) for the theme song!
