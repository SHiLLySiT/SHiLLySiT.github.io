Cooptris is a cooperative Tetris clone. Same rules as the original: don't let blocks reach the top of the screen! Both players share the same hold space which is useful for trading pieces. Your current piece can get in the way of the other player, so good communication is required! This was a small project with the goal to make a game with [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).
