Made for the [2025 Falling Block Jam](https://itch.io/jam/falling-block-jam) using [Playbit](https://github.com/GamesRightMeow/playbit).

I started off with the idea "like that one famous falling block game, but where you remove blocks instead", and this is where I ended up! 

Blocks fall in horizontal lines from the top of the screen. Clear blocks in the shape of your current piece. When you clear a whole row,  all blocks above settle into the gaps below. Don't let blocks reach the top! 


## Technologies
