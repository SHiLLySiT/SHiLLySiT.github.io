You are a solar-powered craft. The sun is your death timer. Hurtle towards the sunset at breakneck speed in a futile race against time. Delay the inevitable by catching speed boosts which reverse the setting sun - if only for a moment. Race The Sun: Daily Challenge Edition is inspired by arcade games of the past with a focus on high scores, short game sessions, and pure fun mingled with nerve-wracking tension. The rules are simple: don't crash, stay in the light, and don't slow down!

## My role
I joined the team well after the game's initial launch, so my responsibilities were primarily focused on post-launch features and cleaning up tech debt.

## Technologies
Unity

## Key contributions
* Redesigned the ship customization system to provide a more robust and  scalable framework for adding new cosmetics.
* Refactored the legacy ad management system to handle multiple types of ads from several sources.
* Provided consultation on setting up an automated build pipeline.
