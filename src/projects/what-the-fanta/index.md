_What the Fanta_ was a marketing campaign for [The Coca-Cola Company](https://www.coca-colacompany.com/) to reveal a new mystery flavor of Fanta soda. The project involved the development of a sweepstakes website and a small game. Using clues hidden on the web page, and additional ones earned by playing the game, visitors would submit flavor guesses to the sweepstakes. The flavor was eventually [revealed via TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@the.navarose/video/7294705488397159723).

The campaign website is now offline, but you can still [play the game](https://gamesrightmeow.com/projects/what-the-fanta/play/)! Collect bags of candy and soda bottles while avoiding halloween themed obstacles. When playing on a touch screen device, tap and hold on either the left or right side of the screen to move the bat. When playing on a computer, press and hold the left and right arrow keys.

## My role
I was responsible for developing an obstacle avoidance game for the campaign in collaboration with [IfThen](https://www.ifthen.com/). My focus was on engineering and game design.

## Key Accomplishments
* Crafted a procedurally generated level system that was stitched together from smaller, hand crafted chunks.
* Optimized the game to run across a variety of mobile devices and desktop browsers.
* Tuned the difficulty to create a challenging, yet accessible experience.
