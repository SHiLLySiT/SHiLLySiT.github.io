Playbit is a framework for creating cross-platform [Playdate](https://play.date/) games from a single [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) codebase. To accomplish this, it has two key components:
* A reimplemention of the [Playdate API](https://sdk.play.date/Inside%20Playdate.html) in [Love2D](https://love2d.org/).
* A build system that utilizes [LuaPreprocess](https://github.com/ReFreezed/LuaPreprocess/) to strip/inject platform dependent code.
