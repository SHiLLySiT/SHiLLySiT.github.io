White Sands National Park: Beyond the Dunes VR transports you into the microbiome of White Sands, among tiny creatures like tardigrades. White Sands is the world's largest gypsum dune field, created by an intricate collaboration of minerals, microbes, and soil moisture. Hear from the scientists researching the biodiversity of White Sands to help us better understand this unique environment. When visiting White Sands National Park, try the app in the VR headsets available to visitors in the park's Visitor Center.

## My role
In collaboration with [Innovative Media Research and Extension](http://innovativemedia.nmsu.edu/) at New Mexico State University, I worked as the engineer and game designer to create a stationary VR experience available to visitors onsite at White Sands National Park.

## Key Accomplishments
* Developed a content management system that allowed the client to freely add new regions, videos, and other content without requiring code updates.
* Created authoring and validation tools to aide content creation.
* Optimized the experience to run on the Meta Quest 2.
