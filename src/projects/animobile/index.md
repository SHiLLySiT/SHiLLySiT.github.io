Animobile Adventures is a game where players drive around exploring habitats and to learn about the animals that live within them. We wanted to teach players how we can learn from animals to solve everyday problems. Throughout the course of the game players earn traits that can be used to transform the Animobile to overcome challenges they encounter. The team was also given with the opportunity to work with [Make-A-Wish](http://wish.org/) and grant Abby Mankâ€™s wish of being immortalized in a video game!
