MedSMA℞T: Adventures in PharmaCity was developed to educate adolescents about safe opioid management. This game explores the life of Shan the sheep, who recently broke their arm. Players help Shan make medication management decisions throughout the day. 

The client hired Filament Games to port the game from WebGL to iOS and Android. However we also added localization with both English and Spanish voice over.

## My Role
I served as the Engineering Consultant to port the original WebGL based game to iOS and Android. 

## Technologies
Unity, Firebase

## Key Contributions
- With the original development team not available and no documentation, I took lead in the discovery phase to uncover tasks required for the mobile port.
- Reverse engineered various systems in order to fix bugs and make improvements.
- Implemented a system for swapping out localized voice overs at runtime, in a [Timeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.timeline@1.2/manual/index.html) based project.
