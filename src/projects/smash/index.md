Smash Palace was a significant milestone in my career as it was the first commercial game that I contributed to. During the development of this project I was in charge of general gameplay programming and AI. The goal of the game is to smash into opponents and do as much damage as you can (preferably until they explode). If you're the last car running, you've survived the round! Between rounds you can spend your hard earned cash on upgrades for your garage full of cars.
