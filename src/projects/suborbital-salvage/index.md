Test your piloting skills in this endless runner set in a dystopian corporate future! Fly your space ship through the dangerous, hazard-filled orbit of Cetos while collecting salvage. Oh, and please try not to feed the fish - your supervisor won't appreciate the policy violation.

__Features:__
- Avoid asteroids, space mines, rogue missiles, and 50+ other hazards.
- Fly your ship with a design specifically created for the crank.
- Navigate procedurally generated salvage runs assembled from over 100+ hand-crafted level segments across 4 unique regions.
- Over 100+ lines of "motivational" dialog from your cat supervisor.
- Outperform other employees across 3 online leaderboards.
