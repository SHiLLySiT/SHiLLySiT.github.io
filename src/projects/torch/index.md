Torch was originally created for Ludum Dare #20 for the theme 'It's dangerous to go alone; take this!'. This is the post compo version which features some level fixes and graphical enhancements. The light/torch concept was inspired by [Amnesia](http://www.amnesiagame.com/). There is a single level that the player must traverse and rescue the girl. Avoid traps and creatures that steal your torch. If you are in the darkness for too long you will be sent back to the most recent checkpoint. Special thanks to [Chris Sinnott](http://www.sinnottsoundworks.com/) for the theme song!
