Dig your way through treacherous caverns while saving damsels in distress in this sequel to the original Caved In. The goal of the game is to descend as deep as you can while rescuing damsels and collecting treasures. As you dig, you weaken the integrity of the level. The lower the integrity, the more often cave ins occur! Special thanks to [Chris Sinnott](http://www.sinnottsoundworks.com/) for the theme song and sound effects!
