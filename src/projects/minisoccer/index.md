You don't have to be a soccer expert to play MiniSoccer - just be ready to have fun! Challenge live players in real-time multiplayer matches with up to 6 people. Create a private room and play with your friends, or join a random match and make new ones. Don't want to be stuck in the goal? Set an AI goalkeeper so you're free to sprint to the ball and score! Set time or score limits and play to your heart's content. If you want to see what it's all about first, watch the action in Spectator mode.
