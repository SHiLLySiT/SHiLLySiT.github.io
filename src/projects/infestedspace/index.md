Your crew is dead. The ship is infested. All you have is a blaster and a flashlight. Can you make it out alive? Infested Space originally started as a Ludum Dare idea, but I ended up dropping out of the jam. Then in July '12 I decided to revisit the idea as a short, one-week summer project. I ended up spending about two months on the project. The gameplay focuses on exploration and staying alive. However I'm mostly proud of the atmosphere that I was able create as well as the visual style, which I stumbled on by accident while messing around in my image editor. Special thanks to [Chris Sinnott](http://www.sinnottsoundworks.com/) for the theme song and sound effects!
