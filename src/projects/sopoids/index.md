The goal of the game is to fend off 7 waves of SOPA ship. Every time a ship attacks the earth, a letter in the word freedom is censored. Once the whole word is censored, it is game over. There are three different ship types: one flies straight at the earth, another follows and shoots the player, and the other sieges the earth from afar. For every 7 SOPA ships you destroy, another supporter (another fighter) will join your cause. All ships are controlled with the same keys, so its a challenge in it self to maneuver them all. If you lose your last ship, it will respawn without any consequences.
