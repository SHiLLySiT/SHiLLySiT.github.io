If you came here expecting something else (like an indie game studio ðŸ˜…) see the [introductory blog post](/posts/hello-world).

What's this meow? Well its a blog! About what you ask? Mostly video games and TTRPGs ðŸŽ²

The real question is, who am I? It's an about page after all, right? Well I've always been terrible about describing myself, so here are some fun facts:

* My name is Alex
* I love food
* I'm a game developer turned technical writer
* I indirectly worked for NASA once
* I like cats (what a surprise right?!)
* I can juggle three clubs
* Did I mention I love food?

If you want to learn more, you can try emailing me, but I'll probably just reply with a GIF. But feel free to send comments and questions to:

_contact [no bots plz] gamesrightmeow [mew] com_

Note: I've used some super high-tech wizardry to obfuscate my email. If you can't figure it out, then you're probably a spambot and shouldn't be emailing me anyways.
