description = "Caved In was originally made for Ludum Dare #21 for the theme 'escape'. The core concept behind this game was inspired by [Minecraft](http://www.minecraft.net/) and [Terraria](http://www.terraria.org/). This post compo version contains a compass to aide the player with finding the ladder as well as some bug fixes. The goal of the game is to dig your way out five levels of dirt and find the ladder. Each level is randomly generated and filled with water, lava, treasure, and a damsel that needs saving. Beware; the closer you get to the surface, the more unstable the cave becomes! Special thanks to [Chris Sinnott](http://www.sinnottsoundworks.com/) for the theme song!"
