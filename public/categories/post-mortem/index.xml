      <description>Nodoku is the first commercial game I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on solo. While it was meant to start a business venture (via GamesRightMeow), it ended up becoming the start of finding a much needed creative outlet. The game is still for sale on Google Play, but I quietly launched it because I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to focus on making money but rather just making the games that I want to make.
What Went Right Small project To avoid the common indie pitfall of spending years on a passion project to ultimately have it fail, I adopted what I&amp;rsquo;ve been calling as the &amp;ldquo;fail fast&amp;rdquo; mindset.</description>

      <description>The first time I attended Midwest Gaming Classic in 2016 (yes this post is 2 years late) I found custom-made arcade cabinets that were going for ~$600. Appalled at the price, I decided to accept the challenge no one gave me and build a cabinet for less than half the price!
I used this awesome tutorial for the foundation of my project and because its so great, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to reinvent the wheel and write new one.</description>

      <description>What is Caved In 2? Caved In 2 is the sequel to the original game that I created for Ludum Dare #21. Since the original was created in such a sort amount of time, I didnâ€™t get to fully explore the ideas I had for the game. The sequel is meant to fill in the gaps that the original missed, such as, a overhauled lighting systems, monsters, and power ups.</description>
