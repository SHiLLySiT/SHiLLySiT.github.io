<p><img src="/blog/retropie_arcade/complete.jpg" alt="completed cabinet" /></p>

<p>The first time I attended <a href="https://www.midwestgamingclassic.com/">Midwest Gaming Classic</a> in 2016 (yes this post is 2 years late) I found custom-made arcade cabinets that were going for ~$600. Appalled at the price, I decided to accept the challenge no one gave me and build a cabinet for less than half the price!</p>

<p>I used <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/2-Player-Bartop-Arcade-Machine-Powered-by-Pi/">this awesome tutorial</a> for the foundation of my project and because its so great, I&rsquo;m not going to reinvent the wheel and write new one. Instead this is meant to be a supplementary post for others who want build their own arcade cabinet.</p>

<h1 id="do-create-detailed-blueprints-in-sketchup">Do create detailed blueprints in Sketchup</h1>

<p><img src="/blog/retropie_arcade/detail.png" alt="detail" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not usually one to plan things (yay spontaneity) but when I do, I try to be as detailed as possible. Since I didn&rsquo;t end up following the plans in the tutorial, I wanted to make sure that everything fit and I worked out any design problems BEFORE I started sinking money into materials.</p>

<p>My first pass in Sketchup was mostly for style and form factor. Since the cabinet was originally meant to sit on the breakfast bar at my old apartment I wanted to make it as compact as possible. Once had all of the parts sitting in front of me I did a second pass with the dimensions of everything to ensure it all fit.</p>

<h1 id="do-make-a-cardboard-prototype">Do make a cardboard prototype</h1>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/2zlSwREmLmiQw/giphy.gif" alt="cardboard cat" /></p>

<p>I unfortunately didn&rsquo;t take any WIP photos because I was so excited about building it, but I did follow the advice from the tutorial and build a full scale cardboard prototype. I honestly think trying to build the cardboard version was harder because I didn&rsquo;t have large enough scraps to make panels in one continuous piece. But it did the job and let me test out the size and button layout.</p>

<h1 id="do-add-a-removable-control-panel">Do add a removable control panel</h1>

<p><img src="/blog/retropie_arcade/under-control-panel.jpg" alt="control panel" /></p>

<p>Instead of permanently affixing the control panel to the cabinet, I wanted the panel to be removable for maintenance and if I wanted to swap out the control panel for a different layout at a later date. While I haven&rsquo;t built another control panel yet, this made the initial wiring so much easier because I didn&rsquo;t need to work in the tiny space under the panel.</p>

<h1 id="do-use-magnets">Do use Magnets</h1>

<p><img src="/blog/retropie_arcade/magnets.jpg" alt="magnets" /></p>

<p>I added magnets to the backdoor panel because I didn&rsquo;t want to deal with any hinges. I had also planned to use magnets to hold down the control panel, but it fit so snuggly that I ended up not needing them.</p>

<h1 id="don-t-be-efficient">Don&rsquo;t be efficient</h1>

<p><img src="/blog/retropie_arcade/breakdown.png" alt="breakdown" /></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t do too much carpentry so I thought I was using my materials efficiently by not leaving gaps between the panels. What I realized as soon as I started cutting was that saw blades have a thickness, so all of my panels ended up being off by a few centimeters. Luckily sanding fixed most of the alignment issues.</p>

<h1 id="don-t-skip-the-plexiglass-control-panel-cover">Don&rsquo;t skip the plexiglass control panel cover</h1>

<p><img src="/blog/retropie_arcade/control-panel.jpg" alt="control panel" /></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t recall why skipped the plexiglass cover, but after a few uses dirt and grime started to show up on the white primer. I ended up just using some gaffers tape as a quick remedy, but eventually I&rsquo;m going to pick up some plexiglass to protect the paint and wood. Plus I can tuck a cheat sheet under it for instructions or art.</p>

<h1 id="don-t-skip-plans-for-paint-job-or-marquee">Don&rsquo;t skip plans for paint job or marquee</h1>

<p><img src="/blog/retropie_arcade/ghetto.jpg" alt="ghetto" /></p>

<p>I just wanted a working arcade cabinet, so I didn&rsquo;t put any planning into the paint job or marquee. So now two years later, it&rsquo;s still a plain white with the speakers exposed. To mock my own lack of planning, the cabinet has been dubbed <em>Ghettocade</em> with a piece of cardboard from the old prototype.</p>
