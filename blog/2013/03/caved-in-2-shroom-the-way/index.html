<p><img src="/projects/cavedin/lost.png" alt="lost" /></p>

<p><em>“I think I’m lost”</em></p>

<p>The player starts out in pitch black with only a small diamond of the level visible. As the player explores, they uncover the level although areas not within the diamond radius are slightly obscured again. While it was my goal to not hold the player’s hand and let them explore, it proved difficult to determine where the ladder would be each level. It was simply a matter of randomly digging around until the ladder was found. I later added a compass that (sort of) pointed towards the general direction of the ladder, but it was a lousy remedy. Yet it did produce a pretty awesome comment from a player: “Good thing this cave has highly magnetic ladders built into it.”</p>

<p>One of the major goals in the sequel was to find a better solution to this problem and make exploration more rewarding. I tried a handful of different methods, but I eventually came up with the brilliant idea of glowing mushrooms.</p>

<p><img src="/projects/cavedin2/shroom.png" alt="cavedin2_shroom" /></p>

<p><em>“DIAMOND!”</em></p>

<p>Mushrooms are placed in caves and there are usually two or three visible on screen at any given time. They give off a dim light that illuminates the tiles around it, even when the player is not in the immediate vicinity and act as landmarks. Since they only spawn in open spaces, the player begins to realize that digging towards mushrooms means they’ll find a cave once they get there and caves contain loot, damsels, and most importantly – the ladder.</p>

<p>Up next: rescuing damsels while trying not to have the cave come crumbling down on top of your head.</p>
