      <description>The first time I attended Midwest Gaming Classic in 2016 (yes this post is 2 years late) I found custom-made arcade cabinets that were going for ~$600. Appalled at the price, I decided to accept the challenge no one gave me and build a cabinet for less than half the price!
I used this awesome tutorial for the foundation of my project and because its so great, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to reinvent the wheel and write new one.</description>

      <description>What is Caved In 2? Caved In 2 is the sequel to the original game that I created for Ludum Dare #21. Since the original was created in such a sort amount of time, I didnâ€™t get to fully explore the ideas I had for the game. The sequel is meant to fill in the gaps that the original missed, such as, a overhauled lighting systems, monsters, and power ups.</description>
