      <description>Cooptris is a cooperative Tetris clone. Same rules as the original: don&amp;rsquo;t let blocks reach the top of the screen! Both players share the same hold space which is useful for trading pieces. Your current piece can get in the way of the other player, so good communication is required!</description>

      <description>Animobile Adventures is a game where players drive around exploring habitats and to learn about the animals that live within them. We wanted to teach players how we can learn from animals to solve everyday problems. Throughout the course of the game players earn traits that can be used to transform the Animobile to overcome challenges they encounter. The team was also given with the opportunity to work with Make-A-Wish and grant Abby Mank’s wish of being immortalized in a video game!</description>

      <description>Dig your way through treacherous caverns while saving damsels in distress in this sequel to the original Caved In. The goal of the game is to descend as deep as you can while rescuing damsels and collecting treasures. As you dig, you weaken the integrity of the level. The lower the integrity, the more often cave ins occur! Special thanks to Chris Sinnott for the theme song and sound effects!</description>

      <description>Smash Palace was a significant milestone in my career as it was the first commercial game that I contributed to. During the development of this project I was in charge of general gameplay programming and AI. The goal of the game is to smash into opponents and do as much damage as you can (preferably until they explode). If you&amp;rsquo;re the last car running, you&amp;rsquo;ve survived the round! Between rounds you can spend your hard earned cash on upgrades for your garage full of cars.</description>

      <description>Your crew is dead. The ship is infested. All you have is a blaster and a flashlight. Can you make it out alive? Infested Space originally started as a Ludum Dare idea, but I ended up dropping out of the jam. Then in July &amp;lsquo;12 I decided to revisit the idea as a short, one-week summer project. I ended up spending about two months on the project. The gameplay focuses on exploration and staying alive.</description>

      <description>Nanonaut was originally created for the #23 Ludum Dare &amp;lsquo;Tiny Planet&amp;rsquo; as a jam entry. I worked with three other people to create this game - Chris Sinnott , Thomas Jackson, and Travis Lucia. It was quite an ambitious project for such a small time period, yet we still ended up with a great game. Nanonaut is a game of exploration and adventure within a randomly generated world of tiny planets.</description>

      <description>The goal of the game is to fend off 7 waves of SOPA ship. Every time a ship attacks the earth, a letter in the word freedom is censored. Once the whole word is censored, it is game over. There are three different ship types: one flies straight at the earth, another follows and shoots the player, and the other sieges the earth from afar. For every 7 SOPA ships you destroy, another supporter (another fighter) will join your cause.</description>

      <description>Caved In was originally made for Ludum Dare #21 for the theme &amp;lsquo;escape&amp;rsquo;. The core concept behind this game was inspired by Minecraft and Terraria. This post compo version contains a compass to aide the player with finding the ladder as well as some bug fixes. The goal of the game is to dig your way out five levels of dirt and find the ladder. Each level is randomly generated and filled with water, lava, treasure, and a damsel that needs saving.</description>

      <description>There are a total of 24 waves that the player must complete in order to finish the game. Normal waves consist of blasting incoming garbage and asteroids in order to obtain spacedust. Spacedust is then used to purchase upgrades for the planet between each wave. Every three waves a boss planet appears; each unique and requires a different strategy to defeat. Special thanks to Chris Sinnott for the theme song!</description>

      <description>Expelliarmus is a short experimental game I created in a few hours. Type out the words that appear at the top of the screen faster than the AI opponent in order to cast a spell. Spells do damage based on the length of the spell. The first wizard to reach zero health loses! Special thanks to Chris Sinnott for the theme song!</description>

      <description>Torch was originally created for Ludum Dare #20 for the theme &amp;lsquo;It&amp;rsquo;s dangerous to go alone; take this!&amp;rsquo;. This is the post compo version which features some level fixes and graphical enhancements. The light/torch concept was inspired by Amnesia. There is a single level that the player must traverse and rescue the girl. Avoid traps and creatures that steal your torch. If you are in the darkness for too long you will be sent back to the most recent checkpoint.</description>

      <description>Love in the Air was created in 48 hours for Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day. It lacks much polish, but overall turned out quite well for my first Flash game! Each wave, there are a set number of hearts that travel towards the player. They must all be shot down with your limited number of missiles. This game was heavily inspired by the gaming classic, Missile Command.</description>

      <description>Voyage of Discovery was created during the #19 Ludum Dare &amp;lsquo;Discovery&amp;rsquo;. This was the first game I ever completed and also my first Ludum Dare. Granted, it was a bit ambitious for a first project, but hey, I finished it! The goal of the game is to colonize all of the islands while managing your supplies and surviving pirate attacks.</description>
