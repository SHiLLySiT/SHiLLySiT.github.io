Appalled at the price, I decided to accept the challenge no one gave me and build a cabinet for less than half the price!</p><p>I used <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/2-Player-Bartop-Arcade-Machine-Powered-by-Pi/">this awesome tutorial</a> for the foundation of my project and because its so great, I'm not going to reinvent the wheel and write new one. Instead this is meant to be a supplementary post for others who want build their own arcade cabinet.</p><h2>Do create detailed blueprints in Sketchup</h2><p><img src="detail.png" alt="detail"></p><p>I'm not usually one to plan things (yay spontaneity) but when I do, I try to be as detailed as possible. Since I didn't end up following the plans in the tutorial, I wanted to make sure that everything fit and I worked out any design problems BEFORE I started sinking money into materials.</p><p>My first pass in Sketchup was mostly for style and form factor. Since the cabinet was originally meant to sit on the breakfast bar at my old apartment I wanted to make it as compact as possible. Once had all of the parts sitting in front of me I did a second pass with the dimensions of everything to ensure it all fit.</p><h2>Do make a cardboard prototype</h2><p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/2zlSwREmLmiQw/giphy.gif" alt="cardboard cat"></p><p>I unfortunately didn't take any WIP photos because I was so excited about building it, but I did follow the advice from the tutorial and build a full scale cardboard prototype. I honestly think trying to build the cardboard version was harder because I didn't have large enough scraps to make panels in one continuous piece. But it did the job and let me test out the size and button layout.</p><h2>Do add a removable control panel</h2><p><img src="under-control-panel.jpg" alt="control panel"></p><p>Instead of permanently affixing the control panel to the cabinet, I wanted the panel to be removable for maintenance and if I wanted to swap out the control panel for a different layout at a later date. While I haven't built another control panel yet, this made the initial wiring so much easier because I didn't need to work in the tiny space under the panel.</p><h2>Do use Magnets</h2><p><img src="magnets.jpg" alt="magnets"></p><p>I added magnets to the backdoor panel because I didn't want to deal with any hinges. I had also planned to use magnets to hold down the control panel, but it fit so snuggly that I ended up not needing them.</p><h2>Don't be efficient</h2><p><img src="breakdown.jpg" alt="breakdown"></p><p>I don't do too much carpentry so I thought I was using my materials efficiently by not leaving gaps between the panels. What I realized as soon as I started cutting was that saw blades have a thickness, so all of my panels ended up being off by a few centimeters. Luckily sanding fixed most of the alignment issues.</p><h2>Don't skip the plexiglass control panel cover</h2><p><img src="control-panel.jpg" alt="control panel"></p><p>I don't recall why skipped the plexiglass cover, but after a few uses dirt and grime started to show up on the white primer. I ended up just using some gaffers tape as a quick remedy, but eventually I'm going to pick up some plexiglass to protect the paint and wood. Plus I can tuck a cheat sheet under it for instructions or art.</p><h2>Don't skip plans for paint job or marquee</h2><p><img src="ghetto.jpg" alt="ghetto"></p><p>I just wanted a working arcade cabinet, so I didn't put any planning into the paint job or marquee. So now two years later, it's still a plain white with the speakers exposed. To mock my own lack of planning, the cabinet has been dubbed <em>Ghettocade</em> with a piece of cardboard from the old prototype.</p><h2>Tools</h2><ul><li>Table saw</li><li>Power Sander</li><li>Electric drill</li></ul><h2>Materials</h2><ul><li>IPAC (via <a href="https://www.focusattack.com/ultimarc-i-pac-2-2-player-usb-pushbutton-and-joystick-interface-pcb/">Focus Attack</a>)</li><li>Buttons (via <a href="https://www.focusattack.com/suzo-happ-concave-long-stem-pushbutton-white/">Focus Attack</a>)</li><li>Joysticks (via <a href="https://www.focusattack.com/suzo-happ-8-way-competition-joystick-black/">Focus Attack</a>)</li><li>Wires (via <a href="https://www.focusattack.com/red-16pc-22-awg-wire-with-187-quick-disconnect/">Focus Attack</a>)</li><li>Powerstrip (via <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TP1C1UC/ref=od_aui_detailpages01?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Amazon</a>)</li><li>RaspberryPi (via <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01C6FFNY4/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Amazon</a>)</li><li>RaspberryPi Case (via <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ONOKPHC/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Amazon</a>)</li><li>Desktop computer speakers (via <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GHY5JAO/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Amazon</a>)</li><li>Wood Glue</li><li>Magnets</li><li>Monitor</li><li>Keyboard</li><li>MDF Boards</li></ul><h2>Software</h2><ul><li><a href="https://retropie.org.uk/">Retropie</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sketchup.com/">Google Sketchup</a></li></ul><h2>Stats</h2><ul><li>Total cost: $264</li><li>Total time (planning, construction, setup): ~5 days</li><li>Nerd points obtained: 9000+</li></ul></main></div></div></div></div><script>let tag=document.createElement("script"),firstScriptTag=(tag.src="https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api",document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]);firstScriptTag.parentNode.insertBefore(tag,firstScriptTag);let player;function onYouTubeIframeAPIReady(){player=new YT.Player("js-player",{width:"450",height:"320",videoId:"",playerVars:{playsinline:1}})}function handleMediaClick(e){let t=window.document.getElementById("js-main-screenshot"),i=window.document.getElementById("js-main-video");window.document.getElementById("js-carosel");let n=e.dataset.uri;n.includes("/")?(i.hidden=!0,t.hidden=!1,t.src=n,t.parentElement.href=n,player.stopVideo()):(i.hidden=!1,t.hidden=!0,player.loadVideoById(n))}</script></body></html>
